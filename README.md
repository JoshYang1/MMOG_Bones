JY - Players collect randomly generated objects and try to return them to their basket for points. Other players can steal the object. Example, could be dogs and bones (perhaps returning to their kennel?). Taking the idea of differing points from JL, could have like golden or rotten bones. Only the player who dug up the bone would know the type, thieves would not know until it was in their kennel. Could add barriers or obstacles which players would need to avoid. There could be 4 - 8 players at a time, competing on the same game. Players can level up depending on who has the most points at the end of the round and progress to other stages where they will compete against similar level opponents. 

JL - Collecting Game â€“
Collecting objects falling from the sky, objects span across a +/-3 point system, i.e. A has +1 point, B has +2 points, ..., N has -2 points, say if player collects 3x A and 2x B and 3x N, he will cumulate a total of +1 point.

Could even do a level concept, first player to 3 wins win. Min(rounds to play) = 3, Max(rounds to play) = 5
