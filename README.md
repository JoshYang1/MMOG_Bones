JY - Players collect randomly generated objects and try to return them to their basket for points. Other players can steal the object. Example, could be dogs and bones (perhaps returning to their kennel?)

Collecting Game â€“
Collecting objects falling from the sky, objects span across a +/-3 point system, i.e. A has +1 point, B has +2 points, ..., N has -2 points, say if player collects 3x A and 2x B and 3x N, he will cumulate a total of +1 point.

Could even do a level concept, first player to 3 wins win. Min(rounds to play) = 3, Max(rounds to play) = 5
