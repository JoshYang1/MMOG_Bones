When the game starts players (dogs) must try to catch the bone placed in a random location on the map before the other dogs starting from their kennel. Players (dogs) must do this without hitting one of the four plus grapes which are randomely placed in the map. If a dog unitentionally or intentionally walks/eats on a grape they loose a point and this grape gets replaced somewhere in the map. If the dog eats/goes on a bone they gain a point. The first dog to get 6 points wins the game and gains one point in the overall game leaderboard.
