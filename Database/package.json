  "description": "There are 4 players, each one a dog, in every game and the aim of the game is to dig for bones. The location of the bones will be briefly revealed before the game starts. Once the game begins, each player will dig for bones to collect and return to their kennel. Each bone is worth 1 point but there are also golden bones which will give 3 points and rotten points which will deduct 1 point. Players can either return the bone to their kennel or an opponent's, for example, a rotten bone. An additional mechanic of the game is players can steal an opponent's bone before they can return it to their kennel but only the player who dug up the bone would know the type, thieves would not know until it was in their kennel. *Could possibly add barriers or obstacles which players would need to avoid?* Games will end once all the bones have been returned to kennels or the timer has elapsed. Whichever player has the most points in their kennel at the end of the game wins. Players then accumulate points and level up once they reach certain threshold.",
